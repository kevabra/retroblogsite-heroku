First, I have to get the full-stack MERN application working in localhost
Then, next step is getting it working heroku

First have node/express backend server deployed on heroku

Then, you have to go into the frontend portion of the directory and then update all references to localhost to the heroku domain

Then you have to go to heroku and make sure all the env config vars are set appropriately

Once you get error on backend heroku deployment site about Cannot GET/ (routing error), then that means heroku backend server is deployed properly
